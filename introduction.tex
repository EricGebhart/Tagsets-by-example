\chapter{Introduction}
ODS markup and tagsets are the best way to create markup output
from SAS.  This book is divided into sections that will enable
you to get the most out of ODS Markup and Tagsets.  The first
section shows how ODS Markup and Tagsets are used.  Using an
ODS destination that is defined by a tagset is no harder than
using any other destination.  The most popular ODS Markup 
destinations are covered in this first section.

The next sections dig deeper into how Tagsets work and what
you can do to modify them or create your own.  This may
seem daunting at first, but frequently it is quite easy to
get Tagsets to do exactly what you want, saving lots of time
and effort further down a project's path.
